This project aims to develop a file-type identification tool using the concept of magic numbers.






This project aims to develop a file-type identification tool using the concept of magic numbers. Magic numbers are unique byte sequences at the beginning of files that can be used to determine their file types. The tool will scan files and analyze their magic numbers to accurately identify their corresponding file formats, regardless of their file extensions. It will maintain a comprehensive database of magic numbers and their associated file types. The tool will provide users with quick and reliable identification of unknown file types, aiding in file management, data recovery, and cybersecurity efforts. Advanced features should include identifying files with mixed identification or embedded files.
